## Why use JoboboFlow?
It's cumbersome to create and manage your job-hunt tracking system. Joboboflow fills that role of consolidating information that's most useful to users.


## How?
JoboboFlow collects data on the jobs its users apply to and saves the data into a MySQL database. This data is then queried to render job info to users.
